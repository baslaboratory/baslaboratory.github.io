<p>
If you are interested in human movement control, skill learning, motor imagery, or action observation, and would like to join the BAS lab, please email robert (dot) hardwick (at) uclouvain (dot) be. In your message please provide:
<br><br>
   -  An outline of your research interests<br>
   - A 1 page outline for a project you would be interested in conducting in the lab. Note that for a project to be viable to apply for funding, it must relate your previous research experience to the ongoing research interests of the lab, and involve using methods available in the lab. Projects will typically have 3-4 'work packages', each of which would eventually lead to a separate publication<br>
    - A copy of your curriculum vitae.<br><br>

Note that the funding opportunities listed above are <b>extremely</b> competitive:<br><br>

    - Postdoctoral Fellows must have published multiple first-author papers in a relevant subject in peer-reviewed international scientific journals.<br>
    - PhD Positions require you to have (or be on target to achieve) a 120 credit masters degree in related subject with a ‘grand distinction’ or equivalent. Having published papers in peer-reviewed international scientific journals will also strengthen your application.<br><br>

Beyond the stimulating scientific environment, there are several advantages for incoming Graduate researchers. Postdoctoral and PhD positions in Belgium are generally well reimbursed, and our lab is located in Brussels, allowing you to work and live in the capital of Europe.
