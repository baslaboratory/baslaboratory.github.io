The Brain, Action, and Skill (BAS) Laboratory examines how humans control movements and learn motor skills. Our research uses a multidisciplinary combination of non-invasive brain stimulation, neuroimaging, computational modeling, and behavioural experiments.
Topics of particular interest to the lab include:

- How we learn and automate movements through extensive practice
- Understanding how imagining actions, and observing the actions of others, affects our movement system
- Addressing the adverse effects of ageing and stroke on movement control

Based in UC Louvain, Belgium, the main office and laboratories of the group are found in the [Cognition and Systems division](https://uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/ions/cosy) of the [Institute of Neuroscience](https://uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/ions) in Brussels, with additional laboratories and testing space found at the [Faculty of Motor Sciences](https://uclouvain.be/fr/facultes/fsm) in Louvain-la-Neuve.
